             <p class="project-title">iGlass</p>
             <ul>
              <li>iGlass is a low-budget wearable device to help blind and visually impaired individuals to create perception of vision from the words they hear. iGlass is simply controlled with voice commands from the user and it has a smart assistant feature for easy communication which can actively converse with the user on various topics from sports, politics, health etc. and another important feature is giving visual impaired individuals ability to browse the internet.</li>
              <li>Inspired by blind couples in Lagos, the Opebiyi’s who despite all odds go through struggle of child upbringing, providing for the family. Also inspired by Aisha, a blind student determined to complete her studies in the university despite the high cost of braille papers and learning kits, social barriers experienced and inability to access quality information from the internet.</li>
              <li>According the World Health Organization there about 1.13 million people in Nigeria like Aisha and the Opebiyi couples. The difficulty of not been able to see or even appreciate one’s surrounding, happenings and people's facial expressions is disheartening. This triggered us to desire to make a change in the society.</li>
              <li>We at Kyaun Technologies are using artificial intelligence, cloud computing, web engineering and other technologies to develop a low-budget wearable device to help the blind and visually impaired individuals to create perception of vision.</li>
